# Farm_Hotel_Link

Project Overview
The Farm Hotel Link is a web-based platform designed to connect farmers and hotel owners. This system allows hotel owners to browse and order fresh produce directly from farmers, enabling a seamless supply chain for the hospitality industry. Farmers can manage their orders, track shipments, and update order statuses, while hotel owners can place orders, track their progress, and view order history.

Features
1.User Types: The system supports two types of users:

*Farmer: Can list products, manage orders, and track order statuses.
*Hotel Owner: Can browse products, place orders, view order history, and track shipments.
2.Order Management:

*Both farmers and hotel owners can cancel orders, and the system tracks who canceled the order.
*Farmers can update order statuses through an order tracking system, with hotel owners able to view updates.
3.Location Management:

*Both farmers and hotel owners can save and display their geographic location (latitude and longitude) on their profile pages.
*Order details will include clickable location links to help with planning deliveries.
4.Profile Pages: Each user type has a dedicated profile page where personal information, product listings (for farmers), and order history (for both farmers and hotel owners) are displayed.

5.Authentication: Users can log in and reset passwords through a secure authentication system.

6.Future Enhancements
*Add payment integration for processing orders.
*Introduce ratings and reviews for both farmers and hotel owners.
*Improve the mobile responsiveness and user interface design.
